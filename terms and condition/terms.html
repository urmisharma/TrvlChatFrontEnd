the trvlchat website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.

<h3>Collection of your Personal Information</h3>
<p>trvlchat may collect personally identifiable information, such as your name. If you purchase
trvlchat's products and services, we collect billing and credit card information. This information is
used to complete the purchase transaction. trvlchat may also collect anonymous demographic
information, which is not unique to you, such as your age and gender. We may gather additional
personal or non-personal information in the future.
<br>
<br>
Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by
trvlchat. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times
and referring website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to
maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the trvlchat
website.
<br>
<br>
Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally
sensitive data through trvlchat's public message boards, this information may be collected and used
by others.
<br>
<br>
trvlchat encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from
trvlchat so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information.
trvlchat is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the
trvlchat website.
</p>
<h3>Use of your Personal Information</h3>
<p>trvlchat collects and uses your personal information to operate its website(s) and deliver the
services you have requested.
<br>
<br>
trvlchat may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or
services available from trvlchat and its affiliates. trvlchat may also contact you via surveys to
conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be
offered.
trvlchat does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.<br>
trvlchat may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a
particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable
information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. trvlchat

<h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
<p>The trvlchat website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie
is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run
programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only
be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
<br>
<br>
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The
purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For
example, if you personalize trvlchat pages, or register with trvlchat site or services, a cookie helps
trvlchat to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of
recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on.
When you return to the same trvlchat website, the information you previously provided can be
retrieved, so you can easily use the trvlchat features that you customized.
<br>
<br>
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept
cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you
choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the
trvlchat services or websites you visit.
</p>

<h3>Security of your Personal Information</h3>
<p>trvlchat secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When
personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected
through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
</p>

<h3>Children Under Thirteen</h3>
<p>trvlchat does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age
of thirteen. If you are under the age of thirteen, you must ask your parent or guardian for
permission to use this website.
